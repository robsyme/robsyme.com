## Personal Homepage

This is the source for my homepage which will be up (soon) at robsyme.com

## Details

The generation of the site is a little convoluted, but it suits the way I work. Posts are authored in emacs orgmode, which is then published to souce/ and then compiled into a static site by [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and served by [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
